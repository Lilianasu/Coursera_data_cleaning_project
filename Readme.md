CourseraÂ´s Getting and Cleaning Data Course

Final Project

Liliana Hirugame

September, 2016

The intention of the run_analysis.R script is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data used is from the site: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Description of the project  :pushpin:

The components of this Course's Final Project are as follows.

1) CodeBook.md
   A code book that describes the variables, the structure of the finaltidydataset.csv, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data. 
2) finaltidydataset.csv 
  A tidy data set as described in the CodeBook, in csv format.
3) A script for performing the analysis

## Description of the script :green_apple:
### 0. Getting the land ready  
0.1 Install packages and libraries
```
install.packages("downloader")
library(downloader)
library(dplyr)    # Data frames tool
library(reshape2) # Help with melt and cast of data frames
```
0.2 Set working directory. Download and unzip files in "wearable" folder.

A datacleaningfinalproject folder is created, and is set as the working directory. This is where the raw data is downloaded.
```
if(!exists("~/datacleaningfinalproject")){dir.create("~/datacleaningfinalproject")}
setwd("~/datacleaningfinalproject")
myurl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download(url = myurl, destfile="./wearable.zip")
unzip("./wearable.zip")
```

### 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1.1 Reading the Test and Train sets.

These two sets are read into dataframes.
```
testset <- read.table("./wearable/test/X_test.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
trainset <- read.table("./wearable/train/X_train.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
```
1.2 Binding both sets.

Take into account that first comes Test, second Train
```
testandtrainset <- rbind(testset,trainset)
```
Getting the names of the features columns, and the mask for the mean and standard deviation data.

The names of the columns are read in order to filter only those which are mean or standard deviation related.
```
features <- read.table("./wearable/features.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
featureslist <- features[,2]
featuresmask <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", featureslist)
featureslist <- featureslist[featuresmask]
```
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
2.1 Delimiting the testandtrainset set to the mean and standard deviation data
```
testandtrainset <- select(testandtrainset, featuresmask)
```
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
3.1 Adding descriptive names to the columns.

The names are taken from wearable\features.txt
```
colnames(testandtrainset) <- featureslist
```
3.2 Reading Test and Train Activities, setting them as factors
```
testactivities <- read.table("./wearable/test/y_test.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
testactivities <- mutate(testactivities, V1=as.factor(V1) )
trainactivities <- read.table("./wearable/train/y_train.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
trainactivities <- mutate(trainactivities, V1=as.factor(V1) )
```
3.3 Setting the levels  to define the activities
```
levels(testactivities[,1]) <- c("walking", "walking_upstairs","walking_downstairs","sitting","standing","laying")
levels(trainactivities[,1]) <- c("walking", "walking_upstairs","walking_downstairs","sitting","standing","laying")
```
3.4 Reading Test and Train Subjects, setting them as factors
```
testsubjects <- read.table("./wearable/test/subject_test.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
testsubjects <- mutate(testsubjects, V1=as.factor(V1) )
trainsubjects <- read.table("./wearable/train/subject_train.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
trainsubjects <- mutate(trainsubjects, V1=as.factor(V1) )
```
### 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
4.1 First comes Test, second Train
```
activities <- rbind(testactivities,trainactivities)
subjects <- rbind(testsubjects,trainsubjects)
testandtrainset <- mutate(testandtrainset, activity=activities[,1], subject=subjects[,1])
```
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 
5.1 The average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
```
ttmolten <- melt(testandtrainset, id=c("activity", "subject"), na.rm = TRUE)
finaltable <- dcast(ttmolten, formula = activity + subject ~ variable, mean)
```
5.2 Save data into .csv file
```
write.table(finaltable, file="wearabletidydataset.csv")
```
